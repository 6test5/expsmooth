# expsmooth
Exponential smoothing function often used to make data forecasts and for analysis of time-series data.
Calculates value of alpha itself

The reason: 
Like we can see on Wikipedia or another sources, alpha value (called "smoothing factor") is шт between 0 and 1. 
In truth it should be in between 0 and 2 and this program takes this into account. 
What allows to achieve the best results in forecasting.
